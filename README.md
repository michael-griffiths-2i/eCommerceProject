E-commerce Final Project Overview 🎉

This project is an end-to-end testing of an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver and JUnit. It consists of two test cases that cover different scenarios of purchasing items from the website. The project is written in Java and uses Maven as the build automation tool.

Test Case 1 🛒
This test case verifies the functionality of applying a coupon to an item and checking the total price after the discount and shipping fee are applied. It also checks the ability to log out after the purchase.

Test Case 2 🧾
This test case verifies the functionality of completing a checkout process using a check payment method. It also checks the ability to capture the order number and view the order in the account section. It also checks the ability to log out after the purchase.

Website 🌐
